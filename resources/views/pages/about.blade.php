                <p>Caps IM is a free service that is dedicated to making the organization of Caps events a little easier.</p>
                <p>With Caps IM you can keep track of games, upload scores, create tournaments/leagues, and even see
                your personal statistics.</p> <p> You only need one person to register an account to make a tournament,
                however we encourage you use a throwaway email and share the credentials so everybody can report their own games.
                We do not send spam emails and I tried to make it as streamlined as possible to register.</p>
                <p> This Web Application is made to be easy and casual to use, if you have any suggestions come find me and
                let me know your thoughts. </p> <p>Currently IM league style play is the priority, however if
                interest is there I can make a tournament generator as well. </p>
